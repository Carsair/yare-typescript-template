### Todo
* Better attacking/energize math so we don't overenergize
* (done) Better handling of "smart" attack for non-circles (it always runs) (trying to fix this with % capacity)
* Ability to go straight at something but also tangent around it
* (done) Early game dump energy into base (trying to do this with easy tick dump logic)
* Some early defense (maybe just tune the gather rate)
* Make it so it seriously doesn't go into the outpost range (even when chasing)

### Longer term
* Big chains from our star out
