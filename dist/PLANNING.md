### Todo
* (done) Better planning for movestrategy spirits to gather energy
* (done) Better attacking/energize math so we don't overenergize
* (done) Better handling of "smart" attack for non-circles (it always runs) (trying to fix this with % capacity)
* (done) Early game dump energy into base (trying to do this with easy tick dump logic)
* (done) In line-mode, newly spawned spirits dump
* Smarter logic around gathering energy from stars based on what is available (include middle star if no outpost)
* Aggression to help us get the outpost
* Ability to go straight at something but also tangent around it
* Some early defense (maybe just tune the gather rate)
* Make it so it seriously doesn't go into the outpost range (even when chasing)

### Backlog
* Better gather to handle multiple shapes?
* Only react with the "tip of the spear" in the line
  * Line needs to move to keep in range with "connection"?
  * This might be bad because tip of spear will be getting energized at 1x but getting attacked at 2x

### Longer term
* Big chains from our star out
* Early outpost taking

### Tourney Plan
* Eco Core
  * Circles perfect
* Fight Core
  * "fight smart" run away and prioritize lowest health
* Abuse circle spawn rate to 40+ by early game
  * Jake F strat overdraw star and go to outpost and then to their base
  * Some Eco abuse where I send a bunch of units everywhere on the board to harass and then re-eco in the background
  * NO: If holding outpost, eco with middle star? Will get out-eco'd probably
* Abuse circle merge/divide to
  * Newly spawned merge to dump into base
  * Stack up a ton of empties near star to overdraw star and go

  ### Tourney Plan 2
  * Avoid outpost
    * Gather middle star?
  * Get mergetogether working
  * Emergency gatherers get energized and attack
    * Same thing ^ emergency defend my star



### Jake F

Circles
Eco gather at beginning, deplete own star and take middle

attack middle at 152
