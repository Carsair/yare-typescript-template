### Todo
* Better attacking/energize math so we don't overenergize
* Better handling of "smart" attack for non-circles (it always runs) (trying to fix this with % capacity)
* Ability to go straight at something but also tangent around it
* Early game dump energy into base (trying to do this with easy tick dump logic)
* Some early defense
